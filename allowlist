# the hack needs a hack in order for static analysis to pass. It's
# permissible to assign the `ClientSession.multicall` property to a
# bool, but mypy doesn't like that, so we'll give the `MultiCallHack`
# class a fake setter that accepts a bool instead.

koji.MultiCallHack.__set__


# this one has a default at runtime which depends on the system
# architecture, but our stub just declares it as 'noarch'

koji.arch.getMultiArchInfo


# this one confuses stubtest because it uses double-underscore
# argument names, which is interpreted as positional-only in older
# typing styles

koji.tasks.BaseTaskHandler.subtask2


# these are handled via __getattr__ at runtime, but for stubs we
# pretend they're properties

kojihub.auth.Session.groups
kojihub.auth.Session.host_id
kojihub.auth.Session.perms


# another method with double-underscored argument names

kojihub.HostExports.subtask2
kojihub.kojihub.HostExports.subtask2


# uses a double-underscored argument name

kojihub.kojixmlrpc.HandlerAccess.call


# this is created by setup_logging1 but not pre-declared at the
# module-level, so MyPy doesn't think it's available at runtime
